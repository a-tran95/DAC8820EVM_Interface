# FPGA-Interfaced DAC

This repository contains code used in my final year project: an FPGA-interfaced Optical Communications Transmitter Testbench. The code is a user interface that allows users to select the frequency clock and PAM level for a PRBS output.




The Verilog code allows users to select the output frequency and PAM types using the FPGA's pushbuttons.
The MATLAB CODE takes the .csv files exported from the oscilloscope and computes the Bit Error Rate.
